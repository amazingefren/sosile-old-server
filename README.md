## SOSILE-SERVER

UPDATE: paused until amazingefren.com is deployed on my server, need a job ASAP, hire-me.txt :|

Reimplementation of [sm-server](https://github.com/amazingefren/sm-server)

Goals are still the same

however,

I do not intend on staying on an express server, once I reach functionality that I find to be suitable for full production, I will redo the server (again) with rust juniper
